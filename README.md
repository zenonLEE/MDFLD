# Multi-Domain Face Landmark Detection with Diffusion Model

This repository contains the code and dataset for our ICASSP 2024 paper titled "Towards Multi-Domain Face Landmark Detection with Synthetic Data from Diffusion Model".

## Introduction

Facial landmark detection is crucial for applications such as 3D facial reconstruction, face recognition, and augmented reality. While current methods work well for real-world images, detecting landmarks in other domains like cartoons or caricatures remains a challenge due to the lack of annotated training data.

In this work, we propose a two-stage training approach that leverages synthetic data generated by a pre-trained diffusion model to detect facial landmarks across multiple domains. Our method generates high-quality paired image-landmark datasets for various styles and fine-tunes an existing landmark detection model to achieve state-of-the-art results in multi-domain facial landmark detection.

## Dataset
We created a large multi-domain facial landmark dataset with 25 different styles, each containing 400 images and annotations. The dataset is publicly available in this repository.
The multi-domain facial landmark dataset is available for download:
